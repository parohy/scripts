### branch üö¶
Run `git checkout -b` or `git checkout` (or with `pull` and `rebase`) without typing the whole git command.
Before running you need to run `configure <project_name> <prefix>` (without `<>`) to configure git branch prefix. `<prefix>` is optional. For more help run `configuration --help`

After configuration you can use branch in local repository.
1. `branch -f my_new_feature` - if exists, then it checks it out. If yet not exists, creates it and checks it out. Branch template: `feature/<prefix>-my_new_feature`
2. `branch` - lists all local branches.
3. `branch -a` - lists all local and remote branches.

Pull & rebase/merge is not ready yet for usage.
